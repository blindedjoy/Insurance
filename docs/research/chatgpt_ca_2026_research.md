Bottom line for SF / Covered California / Gold plans (2026):

Best overall value (risk-adjusted, high “geometric mean”):
	•	Kaiser Permanente Gold HMO
	•	Lowest premiums, $0 deductible, ~$8.7k OOP max.
	•	Top quality ratings, extremely stable financially.
	•	Trade-off: closed network (Kaiser only).
	•	Best if you optimize for downside protection + cost efficiency.

Best non-Kaiser value (access to top SF hospitals):
	•	Blue Shield Gold Trio HMO
	•	Moderate premiums, $0 deductible, ~$8.7k OOP max.
	•	Access to UCSF + Dignity Health.
	•	HMO referrals required, no out-of-network.
	•	Strong balance of cost, quality, and elite care access.

Best flexibility (but expensive):
	•	Blue Shield Gold PPO
	•	Broadest network, no referrals, some out-of-network coverage.
	•	Same OOP max, much higher premiums.
	•	Only worth it if flexibility itself has high utility for you.

Middle-ground flexibility (no out-of-network):
	•	Anthem Blue Cross Gold EPO
	•	Broad in-network choice, no referrals.
	•	Slightly cheaper than PPO, but excludes some major systems (e.g. UCSF).
	•	Compromise option.

Local niche option:
	•	CCHP Gold HMO
	•	Moderate premiums, UCSF access, SF-only.
	•	Smaller network, community-focused.
	•	Fine, but less dominant unless it fits you culturally/logistically.

Enrollment facts (important):
	•	Enroll via Covered California.
	•	Enroll by Dec 31, 2025 → Jan 1, 2026 start.
	•	Jan 31, 2026 is final open enrollment, but later enrollment shifts start date.

One-line recommendation:

If you want maximum downside protection per dollar: Kaiser Gold.
If you want UCSF + lower premiums without PPO drag: Blue Shield Trio Gold.
PPO only if you know you’ll use the flexibility.
