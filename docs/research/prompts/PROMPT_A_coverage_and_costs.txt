RESEARCH PROMPT A: OON Coverage Rules + Cost Estimates

Context: I'm building a financial model to compare Covered California 2026 health insurance plans for a San Francisco couple. Using Spitznagel's geometric mean approach - which heavily penalizes worst-case outcomes ("tail risk").

=== SPECIFIC PLANS I'M COMPARING ===
From previous research, these are the top contenders:

HMO Plans (Gold tier):
- Kaiser Permanente Gold HMO — lowest premium, $8.7k OOP max, Kaiser-only network
- Blue Shield Gold Trio HMO — UCSF + Dignity Health network, $8.7k OOP max

PPO Plans (Gold and Platinum):
- Blue Shield Gold 80 PPO — broader network, ~$17.4k OOP max
- Blue Shield Platinum 90 PPO — lower OOP max (~$8.7k), higher premium

EPO (for comparison):
- Anthem Blue Cross Gold EPO — broad network, no referrals, no OON coverage

=== WHAT I ALREADY KNOW ===
- Kaiser Gold HMO and Blue Shield Trio HMO are top value options
- OOP max is ~$8,700 for Gold HMOs, ~$17,400 for Gold PPO (couple)
- OON coverage is "basically emergency/urgent only" on exchange plans
- No Surprises Act protects emergency care at in-network rates
- Post-stabilization OON care "can get hammered" — but need specifics

=== RESEARCH SCOPE ===
- Focus: Covered California 2026 plans for San Francisco
- Include: Any 2025-2026 updates to No Surprises Act or California law that affect these plans
- Cost estimates: Colorado-specific (ski resort area like Vail/Aspen) — these may be higher than national average

=== GAPS I NEED FILLED ===

I need to understand both the RULES and the COSTS for out-of-network care.

PART 1: NETWORK TYPE COVERAGE RULES

For HMO, PPO, and EPO plans on Covered California:

1. EMERGENCY CARE
   - Is emergency OON care covered at in-network rates per the No Surprises Act?
   - Are there ANY situations where I'd pay more for OON emergency care?
   - Any differences between Kaiser HMO vs Blue Shield HMO vs Anthem EPO for this?

2. POST-STABILIZATION CARE
   - What exactly is "post-stabilization" care?
   - When does emergency coverage legally end?
   - If I'm stabilized in an OON hospital, who pays for:
     * Continued hospitalization?
     * Surgery scheduled for the next day?
     * Physical therapy before discharge?
   - Does this differ by plan type (HMO vs PPO vs EPO)?
   - Does Kaiser have different rules than Blue Shield HMO?

3. NON-EMERGENCY OON CARE
   - Does Blue Shield Gold/Platinum PPO cover ANY elective OON care?
   - What's the OON deductible/OOP max on exchange PPOs (if any)?
   - Is EPO essentially "HMO without referrals" for OON purposes?

4. BALANCE BILLING PROTECTION
   - What does California's balance billing law actually protect?
   - Are there gaps where I could still get surprise bills?

PART 2: REALISTIC COST ESTIMATES (COLORADO SKI RESORT AREA)

Scenario: A healthy 35-year-old breaks their leg badly while skiing in Colorado (out-of-network for their California HMO/EPO plan).

Emergency room visit and initial stabilization is covered. What happens after?

Assuming NO insurance coverage for post-stabilization:

5. TYPICAL COSTS FOR (Colorado ski resort area pricing):
   - Orthopedic surgery for a complex leg fracture (ORIF)?
   - 3-5 day hospital stay after surgery?
   - 2 weeks inpatient rehab?
   - 12 sessions outpatient physical therapy?
   - Follow-up imaging (X-rays, MRI)?

6. REALISTIC TOTAL SCENARIOS
   - Best case: Simple fracture, quick recovery - total cost?
   - Expected case: Surgery + short rehab - total cost?
   - Worst case: Complications, extended care - total cost?

7. NEGOTIATION REALITY
   - If paying out-of-pocket, can you negotiate down from "list price"?
   - What's realistic to expect to actually pay?

I'm currently using $30,000 as my "post-stabilization exposure" parameter. Is this realistic, too high, or too low for Colorado resort-area care?

=== WHAT I NEED FOR MY MODEL ===

- Clear rules: What's covered vs not covered by plan type (especially Kaiser vs PPO)
- Dollar estimates: What's realistic OON exposure in Colorado scenario
- Any gotchas or edge cases I should model
- Whether $30k assumption should be adjusted
