RESEARCH PROMPT B: Kaiser vs PPO + Gold vs Platinum Comparison

Context: I'm building a financial model to compare Covered California 2026 health insurance plans for a San Francisco couple. Using Spitznagel's geometric mean approach - which heavily penalizes worst-case outcomes ("tail risk").

=== WHAT I ALREADY KNOW ===
- Kaiser Gold HMO: ~$18k/year premium, $8.7k OOP max, closed network
- Blue Shield Trio Gold HMO: ~$21k/year, $8.7k OOP max, UCSF + Dignity
- Blue Shield Gold PPO: Higher premium, $17.4k OOP max, broad network
- Kaiser wins on pure numbers — but network is Kaiser-only
- Trade-off: PPO gives flexibility but higher OOP max hurts tail risk

=== GAPS I NEED FILLED ===
My current model shows Kaiser Gold HMO winning (lowest premium + low OOP max). But I'm concerned about Kaiser's network limitations — specifically the "Colorado skiing accident" scenario.

=== PART 1: KAISER TRAVEL RISK ===

The "Colorado skiing accident" scenario - what happens with Kaiser if I need care outside California?

1. KAISER'S NATIONAL PRESENCE
   - Does Kaiser have facilities in Colorado? Other states?
   - If I'm injured in a state WITH Kaiser, can I use those facilities?
   - What's the process for getting Kaiser care while traveling?

2. EMERGENCY AWAY FROM HOME
   - If I go to a non-Kaiser ER in Colorado, is that covered?
   - At what point does "emergency" coverage end?
   - What happens if I need surgery the day after the ER visit?

3. POST-EMERGENCY SCENARIO
   - I break my leg skiing, go to Vail ER, get stabilized
   - Can I get follow-up surgery at Kaiser?
   - Do I have to fly back to California for non-emergency care?
   - What if I can't be moved for 2 weeks?

4. REALISTIC WORST CASE FOR KAISER
   - What's the realistic OON exposure for a Kaiser member with a serious injury in Colorado?
   - Are there any Kaiser-specific protections or programs for this?
   - Is Kaiser's travel risk worse than, same as, or better than other HMOs?

=== PART 2: GOLD VS PLATINUM COMPARISON ===

For Covered California 2026 in San Francisco:

5. ACTUAL PREMIUM DIFFERENCE
   - For a couple (both age 35), what's the monthly premium difference between:
     * Blue Shield Gold 80 PPO vs Platinum 90 PPO?
     * Kaiser Gold HMO vs Platinum HMO?
   - Annual premium difference?

6. OOP MAX COMPARISON
   - What's the exact in-network OOP max for Gold vs Platinum plans?
   - Are the OOP max numbers standardized across carriers at each tier?
   - Is there an OON OOP max on the PPO plans?

7. OTHER COST-SHARING
   - Deductible differences (Gold vs Platinum)?
   - Copay/coinsurance differences for common services?
   - Any services that cost significantly more on Gold?

8. BREAK-EVEN ANALYSIS
   - At what level of healthcare usage does Platinum become cheaper than Gold?
   - For a healthy couple, is Gold or Platinum likely to cost less total?

9. NETWORK DIFFERENCES
   - Is the network the same for Gold vs Platinum within the same carrier?
   - Any coverage differences besides cost-sharing?

=== WHAT I NEED FOR MY MODEL ===

For Kaiser risk:
- Quantified OON exposure estimate for Colorado scenario
- Whether Kaiser is significantly worse than PPO for travel

For Gold vs Platinum:
- Exact premium and OOP max numbers
- Whether Platinum's lower OOP max justifies higher premium (for tail risk protection)
