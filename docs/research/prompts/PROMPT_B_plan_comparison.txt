RESEARCH PROMPT B: Kaiser Travel Risk + Gold vs Platinum Numbers

Context: I'm building a financial model to compare Covered California 2026 health insurance plans for a San Francisco couple. Using Spitznagel's geometric mean approach - which heavily penalizes worst-case outcomes ("tail risk").

=== WHAT I ALREADY KNOW (FROM PROMPT A RESEARCH) ===

Emergency & OON Rules (applies to ALL plan types equally):
- Emergency OON: Protected at in-network rates (No Surprises Act)
- Air ambulance: Protected by federal law
- Ground ambulance: NOT protected ($500-$2,000 exposure)
- Post-stabilization: Covered until consent waiver signed
- 50% of patients sign consent waivers, exposing to full OON charges

PPO OON Coverage (Blue Shield on Covered California):
- OON deductible: $5,500 individual
- OON coinsurance: 50% after deductible
- OON OOP max: $25,000 individual / $50,000 couple

Post-Stabilization Exposure (tiered model for Colorado ski scenario):
- Best case: $3,000 (simple fracture, quick discharge)
- Expected case: $15,000 (surgery, transfer arranged)
- Moderate worst: $35,000 (surgery, stays at OON hospital)
- Catastrophic: $75,000 (complications, extended stay)

Current Plan Estimates:
- Kaiser Gold HMO: ~$18k/year premium, $8.7k OOP max, Kaiser-only network
- Blue Shield Trio Gold HMO: ~$21k/year, $8.7k OOP max, UCSF + Dignity
- Blue Shield Gold PPO: Higher premium, $17.4k in-network OOP max

=== GAPS I NEED FILLED ===

PART 1: KAISER-SPECIFIC TRAVEL RISK

Since all HMOs have equal emergency protection (No Surprises Act), the question is: **What makes Kaiser different for post-stabilization care?**

1. KAISER'S NATIONAL NETWORK
   - Does Kaiser have facilities in Colorado? Which states?
   - If I'm injured in a state WITH Kaiser (e.g., Colorado, Washington), can I use those Kaiser facilities with my California plan?
   - What's Kaiser's "out-of-area" care policy for non-emergencies?

2. KAISER'S POST-STABILIZATION PROCESS
   - If I'm stabilized at a non-Kaiser ER in Colorado:
     * Does Kaiser have any special programs to coordinate my care?
     * Will Kaiser authorize non-emergency surgery at the OON hospital?
     * What's Kaiser's timeline expectation for transfer back to California?
   - What if I'm medically unable to travel for 2+ weeks?

3. KAISER VS OTHER HMOS FOR TRAVEL
   - Is Kaiser's closed network MORE restrictive than Blue Shield Trio HMO for post-stabilization?
   - Does Blue Shield Trio have any OON coverage advantages Kaiser lacks?
   - Any Kaiser-specific policies that make travel risk better or worse?

4. KAISER MEMBERS' ACTUAL EXPERIENCE
   - What do Kaiser members actually do when seriously injured out-of-state?
   - Are there horror stories or success stories specific to Kaiser?
   - Is this a real risk or mostly theoretical?

PART 2: GOLD VS PLATINUM EXACT NUMBERS

I need the actual 2026 numbers to run my model.

5. PREMIUM COMPARISON (SF couple, both age 35)
   - Blue Shield Gold 80 PPO: Monthly premium? Annual?
   - Blue Shield Platinum 90 PPO: Monthly premium? Annual?
   - Kaiser Gold HMO: Monthly premium? Annual?
   - Kaiser Platinum HMO: Monthly premium? Annual?
   - Blue Shield Trio Gold HMO: Monthly premium? Annual?

6. IN-NETWORK OOP MAX (couple)
   - Gold tier OOP max (is it $8,700 or $17,400 for couple?)
   - Platinum tier OOP max (is it lower?)
   - Are these standardized across carriers or do they vary?

7. DEDUCTIBLE & COST-SHARING
   - Gold deductible vs Platinum deductible?
   - Key copay differences (office visit, specialist, ER)?
   - Any services where Gold is significantly more expensive before OOP max?

8. BREAK-EVEN ANALYSIS
   - For a healthy couple with ~$400/year medical costs, which tier costs less total?
   - At what healthcare spending level does Platinum become cheaper than Gold?
   - Does the lower Platinum OOP max justify the premium for tail risk protection?

=== WHAT I NEED FOR MY MODEL ===

Kaiser risk:
- Is Kaiser significantly worse than Blue Shield HMOs for Colorado scenario?
- Specific dollar amount difference (if any) in expected OON exposure

Gold vs Platinum:
- Exact 2026 premiums for each plan option
- Whether Platinum's lower OOP max is worth the premium increase
- Recommendation for Spitznagel-style tail risk optimization
