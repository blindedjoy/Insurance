# Out-of-network ski injury exposure for Covered California 2026 plans

**The No Surprises Act fundamentally limits your worst-case exposure—but consent waivers and post-stabilization care remain the critical risk.** For a California HMO or EPO holder breaking a leg while skiing in Colorado, emergency care and air ambulance transport are protected at in-network rates under federal law. The real financial risk lies in what happens *after* stabilization: if you sign a consent waiver (as 50% of patients do) or need extended care, post-stabilization costs at Colorado resort hospitals can reach **$50,000–$100,000+** at list prices. Your current **$30,000 parameter is reasonable for an expected-case scenario** but potentially too low for true worst-case modeling—I recommend a tiered approach with $15,000 expected, $35,000 moderate-worst, and $75,000 catastrophic.

The key differentiator among your plan options isn't emergency coverage (all are equally protected by federal law) but rather what happens if you need *elective* out-of-network care. Only the PPO plans provide any OON benefits beyond emergencies, but with a steep **$5,500 deductible and $25,000 OOP max**—making them expensive insurance against this specific tail risk.

## Emergency care is protected equally across all plan types

Under the No Surprises Act (effective January 2022), all your plan options—Kaiser HMO, Blue Shield Trio HMO, Blue Shield PPO, and Anthem EPO—provide **identical emergency OON protection**. When a Colorado ER treats your ski injury, you'll pay only in-network cost-sharing (your plan's $350 emergency copay) regardless of whether the hospital participates in your California network.

This protection extends to the critical "prudent layperson" standard: if someone with average medical knowledge would believe they need immediate care, the insurance must cover it at in-network rates. A bad ski fracture unquestionably meets this standard. The emergency protection continues through initial stabilization, including medical screening, diagnostic imaging, and stabilizing surgery if immediately necessary.

**Air ambulance transport is also protected.** If Flight For Life Colorado helicopters you from the ski slope to Vail Valley Medical Center, federal law prohibits balance billing—you'll pay only in-network rates. Notably, Flight For Life (the primary ski area helicopter provider) explicitly commits to not financially burden patients regardless of insurance status.

The one gap in transport coverage: **ground ambulances are not protected** by the No Surprises Act. Congress exempted them, though Colorado has been working on state-level protections. Budget **$500–$2,000** for potential ground ambulance balance billing exposure.

## Post-stabilization care is where the real risk lives

The emergency/post-stabilization boundary represents the critical financial cliff. Once you're "stabilized"—defined as no material deterioration likely during transfer—the robust emergency protections begin to erode.

**When does stabilization occur?** The treating physician determines this clinically. For a broken leg, you're typically "stabilized" once the fracture is set or casted and pain is controlled—*not* when you've fully recovered. A patient may be medically stabilized while still hospitalized and needing surgery the next day. This is where risk begins.

**Federal protections continue until you can be safely transferred.** The No Surprises Act protects post-stabilization care until: (1) you can safely travel using *non-medical* transportation, (2) an in-network facility is available, and (3) you consent in writing to waive protections. The critical phrase is "non-medical transportation"—if you still require ambulance transport, providers cannot legally ask you to waive protections.

**The consent waiver is your biggest financial decision.** CMS estimates that **50% of patients sign consent waivers** for post-stabilization care, exposing themselves to full out-of-network billing. If a Colorado hospital presents you with a waiver while you're groggy from pain medication, declining to sign and requesting transfer to a California facility preserves your protections. This is the single most important action to limit exposure.

| Post-Stabilization Scenario | Patient Exposure |
|---------------------------|------------------|
| Declines waiver, arranges transfer | In-network OOP max only |
| Signs waiver, stays for surgery | Full OON charges ($30,000–$80,000+) |
| Cannot safely transfer (needs ambulance) | Protected, cannot be asked to waive |
| Stays involuntarily (medical necessity) | Protected under emergency continuation |

## Coverage differs dramatically by plan type for elective OON care

While emergency protections are universal, your plans diverge sharply on what happens if you *choose* to receive non-emergency care out-of-network—or get caught in the gray zone between emergency and elective.

**Kaiser Gold HMO and Anthem Gold EPO: No elective OON coverage.** Both function as closed networks for non-emergency care. If you're stabilized at Vail Valley Medical Center and want elective follow-up surgery there rather than transferring to Kaiser or an Anthem network facility, you pay 100% out of pocket. Kaiser's specific process requires notification within 30 minutes of emergency care for post-stabilization authorization—failure to follow their procedures could result in denied claims.

**Blue Shield Trio HMO: Similar restrictions with some flexibility.** Emergency and post-stabilization care is covered, but routine OON care is not. The one exception: if your PCP refers you to an out-of-network specialist because no in-network option exists, you receive in-network rates. This doesn't help with a Colorado ski injury.

**Blue Shield Gold 80 PPO and Platinum 90 PPO: Meaningful OON benefits exist.** These are the only plans offering true out-of-network coverage:

| PPO OON Cost-Sharing | Gold 80 PPO |
|---------------------|-------------|
| OON Deductible | $5,500 individual / $11,000 couple |
| OON Coinsurance | 50% after deductible |
| OON OOP Maximum | $25,000 individual / $50,000 couple |
| Emergency Room (OON) | $350 (same as in-network) |
| Hospital Inpatient (OON) | 50% coinsurance, max $500/day benefit |

The PPO plans provide a meaningful safety net: even if you sign a post-stabilization waiver, your exposure caps at **$25,000 per person** (or $50,000 for your couple). However, this is substantially higher than the in-network OOP max of $9,200/$18,400—and crucially, charges above Blue Shield's "allowable amount" do *not* count toward the OOP max.

## Colorado ski resort hospital costs run high

Colorado mountain hospitals charge premium prices reflecting high operating costs in resort communities. Understanding these numbers helps calibrate your financial model.

**Orthopedic surgery costs vary widely by complexity.** A straightforward ORIF (open reduction internal fixation) for a simple fracture runs **$25,000–$40,000** at facility charges, while complex tibial plateau or femur fractures can reach **$50,000–$110,000** including surgeon fees. Aspen Valley Hospital charges among the highest in Colorado—their knee replacement averages **$82,500** versus $38,500 in Grand Junction. Vail Valley Medical Center and St. Anthony Summit Medical Center (Frisco) typically charge below Aspen but above Front Range hospitals.

**Hospital stays cost $2,000–$3,000 per day** at mountain facilities for standard rooms, with ICU rates reaching $3,000–$5,000 daily. A three-day post-surgical stay runs **$6,000–$15,000** for room charges alone; add surgery, imaging, and professional fees and a typical complete stay reaches **$50,000–$80,000** at list prices.

Real-world examples illustrate the range:
- Tibia/fibula fracture with rod and plate at Tahoe Forest: **$53,747** billed
- Broken femur in Colorado Springs plus Flight For Life: **$130,700** total
- Complex fracture with plate failure requiring two surgeries: **$99,159** billed

**Self-pay patients rarely pay list prices.** Colorado's Hospital Discounted Care program (HB 21-1198) limits charges to Medicare/Medicaid rates for households earning under **250% of federal poverty level** ($80,364/year for a family of four). Even without qualifying, negotiated self-pay rates typically run **40–60% of chargemaster prices**, and many hospitals offer prompt-pay discounts of 10–20% additional. Flight For Life explicitly commits to ensuring patients "will not be financially burdened" regardless of ability to pay.

## Air ambulance costs and coverage for ski area evacuations

Helicopter evacuation from a Colorado ski slope typically costs **$20,000–$40,000**, with the median air ambulance flight nationally at **$36,000**. The cost structure involves a base fee of $12,000–$15,000 plus $150–$300 per mile. A 40-mile flight from Vail to Denver's trauma center runs approximately $25,000–$35,000.

**Flight For Life Colorado** operates as the primary ski area provider, with bases at St. Anthony Summit Medical Center (Frisco) serving Breckenridge, Keystone, Copper Mountain, and A-Basin. Classic Air Medical covers the Aspen/Roaring Fork Valley from their Glenwood Springs base. Both accept insurance assignment without balance billing patients.

**Fixed-wing air ambulance** for a medical transfer from Colorado to California runs **$25,000–$40,000** for the approximately 1,200-mile journey. However, this is typically an *elective* transport after discharge—not covered as emergency care. If you're medically discharged in Colorado and choose to fly home via air ambulance rather than commercial airline, expect to pay out of pocket.

The No Surprises Act provides robust air ambulance protection: out-of-network providers cannot balance bill, and your cost-sharing is limited to in-network rates. Before the NSA, half of patients receiving OON air ambulance bills faced charges exceeding **$21,000** beyond insurance payments. Post-NSA, insured patients typically pay only their plan's ambulance cost-sharing ($250 for most Covered California plans).

**Air ambulance membership programs have limited value.** While AirMedCare Network offers coverage for $99/year, it only applies if *their* provider is dispatched—and dispatch decisions are made by 911 operators, not patients. Flight For Life, the most likely ski area responder, doesn't participate in membership programs but already commits to not balance billing.

## The $30,000 assumption needs context-dependent adjustment

Your current parameter is in the right ballpark for expected-case modeling but needs refinement for a geometric mean approach that heavily penalizes tail risk.

**For most ski injuries, exposure is actually lower than $30,000.** If you're properly insured, decline consent waivers, and your insurer arranges transfer to an in-network facility, your maximum exposure is your plan's in-network OOP max plus ground ambulance: approximately **$9,000–$18,000** for HMO/EPO plans, or up to $25,000 for PPO plans using OON benefits.

**The $30,000 figure appropriately models the scenario where you sign a consent waiver** and receive post-stabilization surgery and a few days' hospitalization at a Colorado facility. Colorado resort hospital pricing for uncomplicated ORIF surgery with a 2–3 day stay, negotiated to self-pay rates, aligns with this estimate.

**True worst-case exposure substantially exceeds $30,000.** Complex fractures requiring multiple surgeries, complications extending hospitalization, or elective air transport home can push total costs to **$75,000–$150,000**. With Blue Shield PPO plans, your exposure caps at the $25,000/$50,000 OON OOP max; with HMO/EPO plans, there's no cap once you've waived protections.

| Scenario | Probability | Exposure Range | Model Parameter |
|----------|-------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Best case (simple fracture, quick discharge) | 30% | $1,000–$5,000 | $3,000 |
| Expected case (surgery, transfer arranged) | 50% | $8,000–$20,000 | $15,000 |
| Moderate worst (surgery, stays at OON hospital) | 18% | $25,000–$50,000 | $35,000 |
| Catastrophic (complications, extended stay) | 2% | $50,000–$150,000 | $75,000 |

For Spitznagel's geometric mean approach penalizing tail risk, I recommend using **$35,000** as your primary post-stabilization parameter (representing the moderate worst case), while separately modeling a **$75,000** catastrophic scenario at 2% probability if your model supports tiered outcomes.

## Key gotchas to model

**The consent waiver trap.** Hospital staff may present post-stabilization consent waivers when you're medicated and vulnerable. Declining preserves NSA protections; signing them away exposes you to full OON charges. Model the 50% waiver-signing rate CMS estimates.

**Kaiser's 30-minute notification requirement.** Kaiser requires notification within 30 minutes of emergency care for post-stabilization authorization. While emergency care itself is protected, failure to notify could complicate post-stabilization coverage disputes.

**Ground ambulance is the uncovered gap.** Federal law exempts ground ambulance from balance billing protections. Budget $500–$2,000 for this exposure regardless of plan type.

**Elective medical transport home isn't covered.** If you're discharged from a Colorado hospital and need medical transport to California, this is typically considered elective rather than emergency—expect $25,000–$40,000 out of pocket for fixed-wing air ambulance, or arrange commercial travel if medically feasible.

**PPO "allowable amount" loophole.** Blue Shield PPO's OON benefits limit payment to their "allowable amount"—charges exceeding this don't count toward your OOP max. A hospital charging $100,000 might have an allowable amount of $40,000; you'd pay 50% ($20,000) but the $60,000 difference wouldn't count toward your cap.

## Conclusion: Adjust your model with tiered scenarios

The No Surprises Act has fundamentally improved the risk picture for out-of-state emergencies since its 2022 implementation. Your $30,000 parameter is defensible as an expected-to-moderate worst case but underestimates true tail risk.

For a geometric mean approach penalizing worst outcomes, consider: **$15,000 expected exposure (50% probability)**, **$35,000 moderate worst case (18% probability)**, and **$75,000 catastrophic scenario (2% probability)**. The weighted average comes to approximately **$16,000–$20,000**, but the geometric mean will appropriately weight toward the higher figures.

The PPO plans provide meaningful tail risk protection via their $25,000/$50,000 OOP caps, but at the cost of higher premiums and still-substantial exposure. The HMO/EPO plans offer no safety net beyond federal emergency protections—making informed behavior (declining consent waivers, requesting transfer) your primary risk mitigation tool.
