Out-of-Network Coverage: Rules & Costs in 2026 Covered California Plans

Part 1: Out-of-Network Coverage Rules by Plan Type

Emergency Care (Out-of-Network)

All Covered California plans must cover true emergency care even if you go out-of-network, thanks to both federal and state protections. Under the No Surprises Act (effective 2022), if you have an emergency and end up at an out-of-network hospital or ER, your plan can only charge your normal in-network copay/coinsurance – you cannot be billed extra just for being out-of-network ￼. California law similarly requires that any emergency room treat you until you’re stable and prohibits balance billing for emergency services ￼ ￼. In practical terms, whether you have an HMO, EPO, or PPO, a bona fide emergency is covered as if in-network.

Are there any scenarios you’d pay more for an out-of-network ER visit? Generally, no – not for a true emergency. The “prudent layperson” standard applies: if you reasonably think you need urgent help, it’s treated as an emergency by your plan ￼. You won’t owe more than in-network cost-sharing, and balance billing is illegal in this situation ￼. One major gap, however, is ground ambulance transport. The federal law does not cover ground ambulances, so if an out-of-network ambulance takes you to the hospital, that provider could send a surprise bill (air ambulances are protected, but not ground ambulances) ￼ ￼. Aside from that and care outside the U.S., you’re protected for emergency services.

Plan type nuances: For an HMO or EPO (exclusive provider org), emergency and urgent care are essentially the only out-of-network services covered ￼. If you’re traveling outside your HMO/EPO service area and need urgent care or ER care, your plan still covers it (urgent needs out-of-area are covered by CA law) ￼. PPO plans also fully cover emergencies at in-network rates, and PPOs even allow non-emergency out-of-network use (more on that below) ￼. But in an emergency, all plan types behave the same – you get care and pay in-network costs only.

Post-Stabilization Care

“Post-stabilization care” refers to the medical care you receive after you’ve been stabilized from the initial emergency. Legally, emergency protections extend for a bit beyond just the ER moment. Under the No Surprises Act, once you’re stable, the hospital can seek your written consent to continue treatment on an out-of-network basis (the “notice-and-consent” waiver) ￼. Emergency coverage legally ends when: (1) you are stable enough for transfer or discharge, and (2) you (or your representative) agree in writing to stay with the out-of-network provider/facility despite knowing it may cost more ￼ ￼. If those conditions aren’t met – for example, if moving you is unsafe or you don’t consent to pay extra – then the law says your post-stabilization inpatient care is treated as part of the protected emergency. In fact, the NSA explicitly classifies certain post-stabilization services as “emergency services” that cannot be balance-billed, until you either can be safely transferred or you waive your protections ￼ ￼.

Practical example: Say you’re hospitalized out-of-network with a complex leg fracture. The ER has stabilized you (pain managed, temporary splint placed). Now it’s the next day and surgery is needed. At this point, if you can safely travel, your HMO/EPO will likely insist on transfer to an in-network hospital for the surgery. If you refuse transfer and choose to stay out-of-network for convenience, you’d be asked to sign a consent accepting out-of-network charges – and after signing, you’d be on the hook for costs beyond your normal cost-sharing ￼. If you don’t/can’t consent (e.g. you’re unconscious or transfer is too risky), then the out-of-network hospital must continue to limit your bills to in-network amounts and can’t charge more. The protection ends once you’re stable and either discharged or safely moved to an in-network facility ￼ ￼.

Who pays for ongoing care if you stay at the OON hospital? If you meet the criteria above (unable to transfer, no consent), your insurer must continue covering the hospitalization as if in-network – you pay in-network cost-share only, and the plan and hospital will negotiate the rest via arbitration if needed ￼ ￼. However, if you elect to stay out-of-network when transfer is an option (by signing the waiver), you effectively become an out-of-network patient for post-stabilization care. For HMO/EPO members, that means no further coverage (you’d be “self-pay” for all those subsequent hospital days, surgery, etc., aside from the initial ER work-up). For PPO members, your plan would then pay according to its out-of-network terms (e.g. perhaps 50% of allowed charges after a separate deductible), and you’d be responsible for big out-of-network coinsurance plus any balance-billed amounts above the plan’s allowed rate ￼ ￼. In other words, on a PPO you’d get some coverage for elective extended OON care, but it’s still costly.

Summary: HMO/EPO plans cover emergencies (and urgent care traveling) out-of-network, but stop paying after you’re stable unless an exception or transfer is arranged. PPO plans will also try to transfer you when possible, but if you insist on staying out-of-network, the PPO at least provides an out-of-network benefit (with high cost-sharing) rather than zero coverage. The No Surprises Act’s post-stabilization rule means you’re generally safe from surprise bills until you can be moved. Once you can be moved and agree to either transfer or to assume costs, that’s when the meter starts running on potential out-of-network charges.

Non-Emergency Out-of-Network Care

Outside of emergencies or urgent travel needs, HMO and EPO plans do not cover elective out-of-network care at all. This means if you choose to see an out-of-network doctor or go to an out-of-network facility on your own (for a non-emergency), an HMO/EPO will not pay a dime – you’d be 100% responsible. An EPO is essentially like an HMO in this regard: you must stay within the exclusive provider network (no referrals needed for specialists in-network, but no coverage if you stray outside) ￼. Covered California explicitly notes that with HMOs and EPOs, “out-of-network services are only covered for urgent or emergency care.” ￼

PPO plans, on the other hand, do offer coverage for elective out-of-network services, albeit at a higher cost to you ￼. If you have (for example) a Blue Shield Gold PPO or Platinum PPO through Covered CA, you can choose to see non-network providers, but you’ll typically face a separate out-of-network deductible and a much higher coinsurance. For instance, one 2024 Gold PPO plan has a $350 individual deductible in-network vs. $1,000 out-of-network, and an out-of-pocket maximum of about $7,800 (in) vs. $12,850 (out) per individual ￼. Family OOP limits are roughly double (e.g. ~$15.6K in vs $25.7K out for that plan) ￼. In practice, a PPO might cover, say, 50% of the allowed charges out-of-network after you meet the OON deductible. You will also owe any balance above the insurer’s “allowed amount,” since OON providers can charge more than the plan’s rate – that extra balance-billed amount does not count toward your OOP max ￼ ￼. This is why using a PPO out-of-network can still lead to huge bills.

In short, Covered CA PPO plans do cover elective out-of-network care, but with significant patient cost. Covered CA EPOs are essentially “HMOs without referrals” – you must use the network except for emergencies/urgent travel situations ￼. When comparing specific plans: Kaiser’s HMO, Blue Shield’s Trio HMO, and Anthem’s EPO will not pay for non-emergency OON services. Blue Shield’s PPO will pay for OON services, but expect perhaps a 50% coinsurance and very high possible OOP costs (the couple’s Gold PPO OOP could be on the order of ~$25k out-of-network vs ~$17k in-network for the two of you, based on typical limits).

Balance Billing Protections in California

California has strong state laws that complement the federal No Surprises Act to protect consumers from surprise out-of-network bills. California’s AB 72 (effective 2017) prohibits balance billing for non-emergency services by out-of-network providers at in-network facilities ￼ ￼. If you go to an in-network hospital, lab, or surgery center, and unbeknownst to you an anesthesiologist, radiologist, pathologist, etc. is out-of-network, you cannot be billed more than your normal in-network cost-sharing for those services ￼. The insurer must pay the OON provider a fair rate set by law, and the provider can’t send you a balance bill. In other words, as long as you followed your plan’s rules and went to an in-network facility, you’re held harmless from surprise bills ￼. (This mirrors the NSA’s protections for in-network facility scenarios.)

California also long banned balance billing for emergency care. Even before the NSA, CA regulators maintained that ER patients can only be charged their plan’s copay/coinsurance, no extra – now it’s codified federally too ￼. The No Surprises Act added nationwide protection in fully-insured plans for emergency services and air ambulances, and it extended protections to self-funded (ERISA) plans as well ￼ ￼.

Where could surprise bills still happen? One gap is ground ambulance bills, as noted. Another gap is if you deliberately choose to go out-of-network for care. For example, if you decide to see an out-of-network surgeon or visit an out-of-network clinic for an elective procedure, that’s outside the surprise billing protections – you could be balance-billed because you had intentional out-of-network care (it’s not a “surprise” in that case). Also, both federal and state laws allow for an informed waiver: if you sign a consent form agreeing to out-of-network charges after being told of your protections, the provider can bill you normally ￼ ￼. This might occur if, say, you prefer an out-of-network specialist and waive your protection to use them. In such cases, you’ve essentially opted out of the law’s shield.

It’s worth noting that California’s law and the NSA together cover most scenarios, but not every scenario. For instance, if you receive care in another state, the NSA still applies, but California’s balance-bill law specifically protected Californians in certain cases that the NSA now largely covers. If you’re on a Covered CA plan (regulated by DMHC or CDI), you’re well-protected. Just be aware that voluntary out-of-network care = you pay whatever your plan doesn’t, and ambulance services remain a last big wild card (a ground ambulance that isn’t contracted can send a big bill – some states have tried to address this, but federal law left it out) ￼.

Part 2: Realistic Cost Estimates for a Colorado Ski Injury (OON Scenario)

Now let’s consider the financial fallout if a healthy 35-year-old on a California HMO/EPO breaks their leg skiing in Colorado, and post-stabilization care ends up out-of-network. We assume the emergency room visit and initial stabilization are covered at in-network rates (thanks to the protections above). The question is: what happens after the ER, and how much could that cost if the subsequent care isn’t covered?

Typical Cost Components (Out-of-Network, No Insurance)

To model the worst-case exposure, here are typical costs for post-stabilization services in a high-cost ski area (e.g. Vail/Aspen):
	•	Orthopedic surgery (ORIF for a complex leg fracture): Surgical repair of a bad leg fracture (open reduction internal fixation with hardware) can easily run tens of thousands of dollars. In Colorado ski country, a complex fracture surgery often costs on the order of $20,000-$35,000 (billed) for the hospital and surgeon ￼. (One legal source noted “a broken leg might cost up to $35,000” to fix ￼.) This figure would include the facility fee, surgeon’s fee, anesthesia, surgical hardware, etc. High-end hospitals could charge even more if complications arise, but ~$30K is a ballpark for a single uncomplicated surgery event.
	•	Hospital inpatient stay (3–5 days): After surgery, you might stay a few days for pain control and monitoring. Hospital charges in resort areas are steep. Average hospital costs are roughly $3,000–$5,000 per day for an inpatient stay (nationally, one day in a U.S. hospital averaged about $3,000 in 2022, and in pricey states like CA it’s $4K+ per day) ￼. So a 3-5 day stay could rack up on the order of $10,000–$20,000 in room and board charges alone. Indeed, even a single overnight admission through the ER can generate $10K–$30K in charges in the U.S. ￼. So for a multi-day post-op stay in Vail or Aspen, costs could easily be in the mid-five-figures just for the hospital room, nursing, and basic care.
	•	Inpatient rehabilitation (e.g. 2 weeks in a rehab facility): If the injury is serious, one might transfer to an acute rehab center or a skilled nursing facility for intensive rehab for a couple of weeks. Inpatient rehab is expensive: studies show about $1,600 per day on average for acute rehab care ￼. For 14 days, that’s roughly $22,000-$25,000. Ski-town facilities might be on the higher end of the range. (If one instead stayed extra days in the hospital itself for rehab, hospital daily charges would apply similarly.) Not everyone needs inpatient rehab, but for a “bad break” scenario we’re including this as the expected case.
	•	Outpatient physical therapy (after discharge): Physical therapy sessions in Colorado without insurance typically cost around $100-$250 per session ￼, depending on the clinic and treatment. Let’s say our patient needs ~12 PT visits over some weeks – at ~$150 on average, that’s on the order of $1,800 total (ranging maybe $1.5K–$3K). Out-of-network, you’d be paying this fully out-of-pocket (though if you have a PPO, some coverage might kick in after a deductible).
	•	Follow-up imaging and doctor visits: A bad fracture often requires follow-up X-rays to check healing, maybe an MRI if complications suspected, and surgeon follow-up visits. An X-ray might be a few hundred dollars. An MRI in a high-cost clinic could be $1,000–$3,000 list price. Let’s estimate perhaps $1,000-$2,000 total for post-op imaging and consultations out-of-network. (If the patient flies home to California for follow-ups in-network, these costs could drop dramatically – but worst-case, assume some are done OON before returning.)

Adding those up, the raw, uncensored cost of the full post-stabilization course could look like: roughly $30K (surgery) + $15K (hospital stay) + $22K (rehab) + $2K (PT) + $2K (imaging). That totals on the order of $70,000 in billed charges. It’s not hard to see how it could range even higher – or somewhat lower if rehab is avoided. Below we outline scenarios:

Total Cost Scenarios (Best, Expected, Worst Case)
	•	Best Case (simpler fracture, minimal OON care): In a fortunate scenario, suppose the fracture is not severely displaced. You get emergency stabilization in Colorado, then as soon as you’re safe to travel (maybe the next day), you fly back to California and get definitive treatment in-network. In this case, OON expenses might be limited to just the initial ER and perhaps a one-night hospital observation in Colorado. That could still be several thousand dollars (an overnight ER admission can hit ~$10,000 ￼), but your plan would cover that at in-network rates. If no surgery is done out-of-network, your out-of-pocket might just be your deductible/copay for the ER. So “best case” OON exposure might be in the low thousands of dollars (or essentially $0 beyond normal cost-sharing) because you avoided expensive OON procedures. In terms of total billed costs, a simple fracture treated non-surgically might have, say, $5K-$10K in ER and casting fees – far less than the worst case.
	•	Expected Case (one surgery + brief inpatient care): This is likely what you’re modeling with a ~$30,000 exposure. Imagine the skier’s leg is badly broken and requires ORIF surgery in Colorado, plus a few days in the hospital, but then they skip inpatient rehab (or do rehab back home in-network). The total charges for that scenario could be on the order of $40,000-$60,000. For example, Sarah Witter’s case (a skier in Vermont) incurred about $52,000 for the initial surgery hospitalization ￼. A similar single-surgery hospital bill in Colorado could be tens of thousands (ballpark $30-50K). Add perhaps $5-10K of other services (therapy, follow-ups) out-of-network, and you’re looking at maybe $40K+ in gross charges. Now, if you have no OON coverage, that could be billed to you; but often providers will negotiate. Many hospitals have self-pay discounts (20-50% off the sticker price is common for cash patients) ￼. If you manage to get, say, a 50% discount off a $50K bill, you’d actually pay $25K. So $30,000 is a reasonable mid-range estimate for out-of-pocket in this “one surgery, short stay” scenario – not too high. In fact, it could end up a bit less with successful negotiation, or more if complications drive up costs. But ~$30K is in the right neighborhood for a significant fracture treated out-of-network (after possible discounts).
	•	Worst Case (complications, extended rehab): In a tail-risk scenario, things go wrong: imagine the first surgery in Colorado is done, but the hardware fails or an infection ensues, and you need a second surgery, plus a lengthy hospital stay and inpatient rehab. Costs can mushroom dramatically. That KFF Health News/NPR report about a ski accident showed two surgeries totaling nearly $100,000 in billed charges ￼ – and that was without even counting a rehab facility. If you had, say, $100K from surgeries/hospital and another $20K from rehab, you’re at $120K+ potential charges. Even with negotiation, you could be looking at tens of thousands out-of-pocket. It’s not unheard of for a complex trauma with complications to run into six figures in medical bills ￼. This is the scenario your geometric-mean approach would heavily penalize – low probability, but very high cost. In realistic terms, a very severe outcome could cost $75,000-$100,000 (or more) in total bills, though insurance and negotiations might reduce the payable amount somewhat.

Negotiating the Bills and Realistic Payment

The good news is that providers often do not expect uninsured/OON patients to pay full “chargemaster” price. If you find yourself facing a huge out-of-network bill, you can typically negotiate with the hospital and doctors. Many hospitals have “prompt pay” discounts or charity care policies. Discounts of 20-50% for self-pay patients are quite common ￼. (For example, one Reddit user noted their local hospital gives up to 50% off for cash payment, albeit off highly inflated rates ￼.) You can also attempt to negotiate line by line, or offer to pay Medicare-level rates. Providers would rather get something than nothing, and they know an out-of-network patient could otherwise refuse or declare hardship.

What’s realistic to actually pay? In practice, people often pay a fraction of the initial bill. If the hospital’s charge is $50,000, the actual cash settlement might be in the $20K-$30K range after adjustments. Professional fees (surgeon, anesthesiologist) can sometimes be negotiated down as well. Additionally, California hospitals (if it was a CA hospital – though here it’s Colorado) are required by law to offer charity care or discount care to lower-income patients; Colorado hospitals have similar policies. Assuming our ski patient is not qualifying for formal charity care, they can still leverage the fact that insurance companies don’t pay sticker price either (insurers negotiate much lower rates). It’s reasonable to push for a bill reduction to something closer to an “allowed amount.”

In your model, using $30,000 as the post-stabilization exposure is a fair starting point for a moderately severe injury. It might even be a bit conservative (i.e. slightly low) for a truly worst-case scenario, but it’s in the right order of magnitude. A single surgery with some aftercare could come in under that after discounts, whereas a complex multi-step case could exceed it. Since you’re concerned with tail-risk, you might consider modeling an even higher worst-case (e.g. $50K or $100K) with appropriately low probability. But for a typical bad ski accident outcome, ~$30K out-of-pocket feels plausible and not overly high – if anything, a serious complication could push it higher. Remember, this assumes no intervention by the insurer; if you had a PPO, some of these costs would be partially covered (albeit you’d hit a high OON max). On an HMO/EPO, you’d be negotiating as a self-pay patient.

Bottom line for the model:
	•	HMO/EPO plans will shield you from most out-of-network costs only in true emergencies. Beyond that, you’re exposed to potentially very large bills if you can’t get to an in-network provider.
	•	PPO plans offer some out-of-network coverage, but you’ll face higher deductibles/OOP limits and risk balance billing above those limits.
	•	A realistic severe injury scenario in a ski area could rack up perhaps $50K-$100K in charges, of which a patient might manage to pay roughly $20K-$50K after insurance payouts or negotiated discounts. A more average serious fracture scenario might end up around that $20K-$30K out-of-pocket mark, which is why your $30K estimate is reasonable ￼.
	•	California and federal laws will protect you in the initial emergency phase, but post-stabilization out-of-network care is a significant financial risk to account for, especially with HMO/EPO plans. Keep those “gotchas” and worst-case costs in mind as you weigh the premium savings of an HMO vs the potential out-of-network exposure with a PPO.
